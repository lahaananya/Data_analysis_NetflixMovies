Netflix Movies Data Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Welcome to my EDA project on Netflix movies! This project dives deep into Netflix’s content to understand trends, viewer preferences, and key factors behind movie success on the platform.

Project Overview:
With streaming services like Netflix revolutionizing how we consume entertainment, this project focuses on analyzing movie data to answer key questions and generate insights. Using Python and popular data science libraries, the analysis includes data cleaning, visualizations, and trend analysis.

Tech Stack & Tools:
Jupyter Notebook
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn


Key Components:
 1. Data Collection & Cleaning
Imported Netflix movie dataset

Handled missing values

Standardized formats (dates, genres, etc.)

 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Identified trends and patterns in genres, release years, popularity, and ratings

Created summary statistics and pivot tables

 3. Visualizations
Used Seaborn and Matplotlib for:
Bar plots
Count plots
Line graphs
Histograms
Designed visual insights for better interpretation

 4. Insights & Takeaways
Shared key insights and observations at the end of the notebook
Discussed implications for content curation and user preferences


Questions Explored:-

Q1. What is the most frequent genre of movies released on Netflix?
Q2. Which genre has the highest average vote?
Q3. Which movie has the highest popularity? What is its genre?
Q4. Which movie has the lowest popularity? What is its genre?
Q5. Which year had the most movie releases on Netflix?


Key Takeaways:
- Action and Drama are among the most popular genres
- Viewer ratings correlate with specific genres more than others
- Netflix releases peaked in certain years, indicating content strategy shifts
- Popularity isn't always linked to high ratings
